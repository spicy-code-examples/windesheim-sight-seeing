# TestExamples
This solution contains examples of how to write Unit Tests using MSTest, AutoFixture, FluentAssertions and Moq.

## MSTest
For an example of how MSTest is used, see `ItemTests` or `ProcessorTests.cs` in the `Logic.UnitTests` project.

## AutoFixture
For an example of how AutoFixture is used, see `ItemTests` or `ProcessorTests.cs` in the `Logic.UnitTests` project.

## FluentAssertions
For an example of how FluentAssertions is used, see `ItemTests.cs` in the `Logic.UnitTests` project.

## Moq
For an example of how Moq is used, see `ProcessorTests.cs` in the `Logic.UnitTests` project.

## TestFixture
The TestFixture class is a class we use to abstract some of the repeating set-up for tests.
It is not needed in order to use any of the aforementioned packages, but does clean up noise.
